Later on we'll need a way to test the language/environment and a tiny Twitter clone will make a good sample app.

Minitwitter "simplespec"
------------------------

The app consists of 8 pages:

	STATIC
		- landing 

		- about

	DYNAMIC
		- login

		- sign_up

		- user: view/reply to tweets; post a new tweet; follow user;
			(same page for the current user as well as others)

		- follow: view/remove your followers and followees;

		- search: list users and tweets according to certain criteria;
			(every page past login -- the so-called "dynamic" pages -- has a search bar at the top which leads to this search results page, which includes both users and tweets)

		- logout
