Language Design Experiment
--------------------------

Let's try to design a language that would be most suitable to writing modern applications, web and mobile, starting with web first.

Twitter seems like an interesting option, as many people use it when writing tutorials for frameworks and such. Let's call our version "Mini" because of its lack of features -- for instance, it doesn't have a "forgot password" page.

Mini Specification
------------------

The app consists of 8 pages:

	STATIC
		- landing 

		- about

	DYNAMIC
		- login

		- sign_up

		- user: view/reply to tweets; post a new tweet; follow user;
			(same page for the current user as well as others)

		- follow: view/remove your followers and followees;

		- search: list users and tweets according to certain criteria;
			(every page past login -- the so-called "dynamic" pages -- has a search bar at the top which leads to this search results page, which includes both users and tweets)

		- logout
